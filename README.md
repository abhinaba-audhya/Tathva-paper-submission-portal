Tathva-paper-submission-portal
==============================
It is a Web-based project . Paper presentation competitions are being held this days in college fests. NIT CALICUT got its own fest "TATHVA". 
We have implemented this portal where a Competitor can enroll him/herself. Then upload paper and wait for result. This portal
has got functionalities for Validator, Judge, Administrator. Though it is a prototype still most of the proposed functionalities
are successfully implemented.
